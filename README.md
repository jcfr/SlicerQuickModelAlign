# SlicerQuickAlign

This is a 3D Slicer extension that allows for rapid alignment and comparison (visual & metric) of two 3D models using ALPACA's point-cloud based alignment approach.

It is freely usable, without any restrictions.

## Installation

- Download and install a latest stable version of 3D Slicer [https://download.slicer.org]
- Start 3D Slicer application, open the Extension Manager (menu: View/Extension manager)
- Install QuickAlign extension

## Tutorial
- Start 3D Slicer
- Switch to "Quick Align" module
- Load the two 3D model files (supports .ply format only - for now) being compared on the left tab
- Click 'Load Models': The two models will be reduced to point-cloud based representation, ready for alignment
- Click 'Align Models': Wait about 5 seconds for software to run alignment & analysis
- Inspect results: 

## Visualize and Analyze results
There are 3 display modes to visualize and analyze the comparison results
### 1. Normal Mode (Default)

The advantage of this mode is that it allows the most simple visualization of the aligned models.

### 2. Wireframe Mode

The advantage of this display mode is that it allows visualization of the internal layers and structures of the aligned models.

### 3. Colour Map Mode

The advantage of this display mode is that it visually highlights areas of difference between the aligned models in colors (Red/Blue).
Colour 'Red' - 
Colour 'Blue' -
