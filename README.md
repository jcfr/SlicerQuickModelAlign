This is a 3D Slicer extension for quick alignment and comparison (visual & metric) of two 3D models using ALPACA's rapid point-cloud based alignment capabilities.

It is freely usable, without any restrictions.

## Installation

- Download and install a latest stable version of 3D Slicer [https://download.slicer.org]
- Start 3D Slicer application, open the Extension Manager (menu: View/Extension manager)
- Install QuickAlign extension

## Tutorial

- Switch to "Quick Align" module

## Visualize and Analyze results
There are 3 display modes to visualize and analyze the comparison results
### 1. Normal Mode (Default)

The advantage of this mode is that it allows the most simple visualization of the aligned models.

### 2. Wireframe Mode

The advantage of this display mode is that it allows visualization of the internal layers and structures of the aligned models.

### 3. Colour Map Mode

The advantage of this display mode is that it visually highlights areas of difference between the aligned models in colors (Red/Blue).
Colour 'Red' - 
Colour 'Blue' -
