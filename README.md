# QuickAlign

This is a 3D Slicer extension that allows for rapid alignment and comparison (visual & metric) of two 3D models using ALPACA's point-cloud based alignment approach.

It is freely usable, without any restrictions.

## Installation

- Download and install a latest stable version of 3D Slicer [https://download.slicer.org]
- Start 3D Slicer application, open the Extension Manager (menu: View/Extension manager)
- Install QuickAlign extension

## Tutorial
- Start 3D Slicer
- Switch to "Quick Align" module: if first time opening the module, wait for additional installations to complete 
- Load the two 3D model files (supports .ply format only - for now) being compared on the left tab
- Click 'Load Models': The two models will be reduced to point-cloud based representation, ready for alignment
- Click 'Align Models': Wait about 5 seconds for software to run alignment & analysis
- Inspect results: 

## Visualize and Analyze results
There are 3 display modes available to visualize and analyze the comparison results
### 1. Normal Mode (Default)

The advantage of this mode is that it allows the most simple visualization of the aligned models.
To enable this display mode, press "1" on keyboard

### 2. Wireframe Mode

The advantage of this display mode is that it allows visualization of the internal layers and structures of the aligned models.
To enable this display mode, press "2" on keyboard

### 3. Colour Map Mode

The advantage of this display mode is that it visually highlights areas of difference between the aligned models in colors (Red/Blue).
Colour 'Red' - 
Colour 'Blue' - 
To enable this display mode, press "3" on keyboard

### Animation

Note that by default, there is a live animation that goes back and forth between the two models to aid in visualization.
To start or stop the animation, press "spacebar" on keyboard
